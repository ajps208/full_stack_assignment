# Full Stack Software Engineer Assignment – Submission Form

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a production-ready full stack application that allows users to submit personal details and track their processing status.

The system allows users to submit personal details through a frontend form.
Submitted data is validated, stored, and processed asynchronously using a scheduled batch job, which communicates with an external API and updates record statuses accordingly.

Only successfully processed records are displayed on the frontend.
